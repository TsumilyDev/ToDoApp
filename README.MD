# To Do App

This is a To-Do app created by Tsumily and Spade. It is intended to be basic initially,
many additional layers may be layed on top later upon the strong initial foundation.

## Philosophy

Practicallity and ease-of-use are among the top priorities for this application; the
design is user-first. A user shouldn't have to struggle to know how the application 
works. They should be able to join and have an intuitive understanding of everything so
they can begin being instantly.

We don't aim to be a an infrastructure-level application, this is not meant to be
used as such either. The goal is to create something more personal for small groups
or individuals to use reasonablly.
